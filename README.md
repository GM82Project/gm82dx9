# gm82dx9
This extension upgrades Game Maker 8.2 to DirectX version 9.0.

Shader and vertex buffer support by Floogle.
Optimized transforms by Lovey01.

## What this enables

    - better window compositing and performance due to using a modern api
    - use HLSL9 vertex and pixel shaders
    - create and use vertex buffers and vertex formats for faster drawing
    - safe surface functions that won't crash the game
    - separate blend mode for the alpha channel
    - resize the backbuffer so you can have proper pixel aspect and good fullscreen
    - control simple rendering properties such as point mode, fill mode, point sprites
    - toggle alpha blend, color write channels, clear the depth buffer
    - set the screen clipping region (scissor test) and other viewport utilities
    - improved default lighting with specular highlights and spheremap reflections
    - plus dozens of extra advanced graphics api functions...
