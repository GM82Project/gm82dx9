--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Application Surface

application_surface_enable(postdraw script id)
    Enables the automatic use and management of an application surface.
    -> The postdraw script will be called when the screen is being composed, so
       any post-processing effects can be applied to it.
application_surface_is_enabled()
    Returns whether the application surface is enabled.
application_surface_get_width(), application_surface_get_height()
    Returns the current size of the application surface.
application_surface_resize(width,height)
    Resizes the application surface.
application_surface_disable()
    Disables the application surface.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Managed Surfaces
  
    These functions will automatically manage surfaces based on string
    identifiers to prevent errors and memory leaks.

surface_get(name,width,height)
    Returns a managed surface with specified dimensions.
surface_set(name,width,height)
    Returns a managed surface with specified dimensions and also sets
    the target to it.
surface_is_new()
    Returns whether the last call to surface_get or set created a blank surface.
surface_reset()
    Resets the render target and sets the default room or view projection
    if views are enabled.
surface_resize(name,w,h,scale,filter)
    Resizes a managed surface with optional scaling and filtering.
    -> If scaling is disabled, the surface will just be trimmed to fit.
surface_forget(name)
    Forgets a managed surface and frees up the memory used.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Regular Surfaces

surface_discard(id)
    Deletes a surface.
    -> This function prevents errors when the surface doesn't exist.
surface_set_depth(id)
    Sets the depth buffer to use a different surface.

buffer_get_surface(buffer,surface)
    buffer: a gm82net buffer to receive the surface contents.
    surface: a surface to get the contents from.
    This function will retrieve the surface's color data into the buffer.
    -> Each pixel is stored as an u32 0xAABBGGRR color value.
    -> The buffer will be resized to fit the surface's contents
       (new size is width*height*4 bytes).
    -> To get a specific (x,y) pixel from the buffer, the address would be: 
       ((y * width) + x) * 4
    -> To get the alpha and color values of a pixel:
       pixel_u32 = buffer_read_u32(b)
       alpha = argb_get_alpha(pixel_u32)
       color = argb_get_color(pixel_u32)
    -> Do note that this function is very slow, so use it sparingly.
    
buffer_set_surface(buffer,surface)
    buffer: a gm82net buffer with the color data.
    surface: a surface to receive the contents.
    This function will push the buffer's color data to the surface.
    -> The bufer must have enough data in it (at least width*height*4 bytes).
    -> You can pack a color and alpha value into u32s for use with buffers
       using argb_make_color(color,alpha).
    -> Do note that this function is very slow, so use it sparingly.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    -> Use this after resizing the game window to get correct pixel
       aspect ratio and crisp rendering.
window_set_fullscreen_ext(enable)
    Experimental exclusive fullscreen support. Very buggy.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Transformation helpers

d3d_transform_set_matrix(m11,m12,m13,m14,m21,m22,m23,m24,
                         m31,m32,m33,m34,m41,m42,m43,m44)
    Sets the world transform matrix.
d3d_transform_vertex(x,y,z)

    z - z rotation
    s - scale
    t - translate
    -> Any combination of rotations is valid, but scale must be last,
       and translate is mandatory. For example, d3d_transform_yxzst(),
       or d3d_transform_xt() are valid.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Shaders

    Shaders are advanced graphics programs that can modify vertices or fragments
    (more frequently known as pixels or texels) when drawing.
    -> When using shaders, any fixed-function effects such as fog, 3d lighting,
       alpha testing, and things like texture indexing modes will not work.
       Those effects need to be manually implemented as necessary.
    -> A few examples are provided in the examples folder.

    Moreover, the shader version dictates how they need to be used:
    -> You can use a version 2 vertex shader by itself, or with a pixel shader.
    -> You can use a version 2 pixel shader by itself, or with a vertex shader.
    -> You cannot combine version 2 and 3 shaders simultaneously, but you can
       use them interchangeably in the same project.
    -> When using a version 3 shader of either kind, an accompanying shader
       of the other kind is strictly required. Passthrough shaders are supplied
       for this end. For example, when using a version 3 pixel shader, set the
       vertex passthrough.

shader_set(vertex,pixel)
    vertex: a vertex shader.
    pixel: a pixel shader.
    Sets both the vertex and pixel shader. Their model versions should match,
    i.e. a VS2.0 goes with a PS2.0 and a VS3.0 goes with a PS3.0.
shader_vertex_set_passthrough()
    Applies the Shader Model 3.0 passthrough vertex shader.
shader_pixel_set_passthrough()
    Applies the Shader Model 3.0 passthrough pixel shader.

    Resets both the vertex and the pixel shaders.
shader_draw_shadertoy(shader,x,y,w,h,time)
    shader: a ShaderToy shader from Anvil
    x,y,w,h: position to draw
    time: in seconds
    Draws a ShaderToy shader. Not all shaders can be drawn with this.
    -> This function is not all-encompassing. If a shader doesn't work, copy
       the source code and adapt it to your needs.
    -> For normal shaders, you should probably use draw_quad() instead.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Vertex Shaders

    Vertex shaders are graphics programs that can modify the properties of
    polygon vertices as they're rendered. They're most commonly seen simply
    moving vertices from world space to screen space. They can also be used to
    perform cheap 3D lighting, fog calculations, and morphing such as model
    bone animation.

    -> Uniform names are accepted as strings.
       If a name is invalid, an error will be thrown.
    -> Struct and array accessors are also accepted, e.g. "a.b[5]".
    -> There are 256 numerical register IDs, but matrices take up 4 registers,
       so only registers 0 through 252 are valid.
    -> This function should be called after setting the relevant pixel shader.
    -> Accepted matrices are: mtx_world, mtx_view, mtx_projection,
       mtx_world_view, mtx_view_projection, mtx_world_view_projection
    -> Notice that the world matrix will change whenever a transform is applied.
texture_set_stage(sampler,texture)
    sampler: a uniform name, or its sampler ID
    Sets the given texture as a uniform in the pixel shader.
    -> Sampler uniform names are accepted as strings.
       If a name is invalid, an error will be thrown.
    -> Struct and array accessors are also accepted, e.g. "a.b[5]".
    -> This function should be called after setting the relevant pixel shader.
texture_set_stage_interpolation(sampler,linear)
    sampler: a uniform name, or its sampler ID
    linear: true is bilinear, false is nearest neighbour
    Sets the interpolation mode for a given sampler in the pixel shader.
    -> Sampler uniform names are accepted as strings.
       If a name is invalid, an error will be thrown.
    -> This function should be called after setting the relevant pixel shader.
texture_set_stage_repeat(sampler,hrepeat,vrepeat,bordercolor)
    Sets the texture repeat method for a given sampler in the pixel shader,
    separately for each direction and optionally with a border color.
    -> Sampler uniform names are accepted as strings.
       If a name is invalid, an error will be thrown.
    -> Arguments are similar to texture_set_repeat_ext.
    -> This function should be called after setting the relevant pixel shader.
shader_pixel_destroy(shader)
    shader: a pixel shader
    Deletes a given pixel shader from memory.
